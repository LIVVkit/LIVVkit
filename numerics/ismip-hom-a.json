    "Description": "The Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project for Higher-Order Models (ISMIP-HOM) prescribes a set of experiments meant to test the implementation of higher-order physics. The results of this benchmark experiment was published in The Cryosphere and can be found <a target=_blank href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/tc-2-95-2008\">here.</a> <br> <br>Experiment A (shown here), simulates a parallel-sided slab of ice lying on a sloped bed that has a series of sinusoidal oscillations. The experimental domain is a square of side length L, with periodic boundary conditions applied in the horizontal. The ice thickness is 1000 m, the slope is 0.5 &deg; (maximum in x, zero in y), the amplitude of the bed oscillations is 500 m, and the frequency of the oscillations is &#969; = 2 &#960;/L.",

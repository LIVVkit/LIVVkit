    "Description": "The Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project for Higher-Order Models (ISMIP-HOM) prescribes a set of experiments meant to test the implementation of higher-order physics. The results of this benchmark experiment was published in The Cryosphere and can be found <a target=_blank href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/tc-2-95-2008\">here.</a> <br> <br>Experiment F (shown here), is a prognostic experiment for which the free surface is allowed to relax until a steady state is reached (for zero surface mass balance). For this experiment, A slab of ice with mean thickness H = 1000 m is resting on a sloping bed with a mean slope of  &#945; = 3.0 &deg; (maximum in x, zero in y). The bedrock plane is parallel to the surface plane and is perturbed by a Gaussian bump, where &#963; = 10 H, the perturbation has a maximum height of H/10, and the domain size L is taken to be 100 H in x and y. Periodic boundary conditions are applied in the horizontal. Experiments shown below are carried out for a beds with no slip.",

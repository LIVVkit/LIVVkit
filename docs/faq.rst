Frequently Asked Questions

Why is the output website blank? 
--------------------------------

Web browsers are disabling the use of local resources, like javascript, when viewing local files
(``file://``) due to possible security risks. As of writing this (2017/05/11), Firefox and Safari
will still display the output websites appropriately, but Chrome will not (IE/Edge untested), and
Firefox is slated to disable access in an upcoming release. 

Fortunately, there is an easy workaround! Python comes with a built in HTTP server, which can be
used to serve the website, and will run the javascript. First, move into the output website
directory (typically ``cd vv_$YEAR_$MONTH_$DAY``), and launch the server. Use either:

.. code:: sh

   python2 -m SimpleHTTPServer

or 

.. code:: sh

    python3 -m http.server

*Note, this will capture your terminal until you're done using the server (use* ``ctrl+c`` *to kill
it).* Now, open your favorite web browser and navigate to ``http://localhost:8000/index.html``. You
should now be able to see the contents of the website. If you're still having problems, `open an

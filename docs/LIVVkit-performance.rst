Performance
===========

Performance analysis of an ice sheet model can be used to quantify it's
complexity. LIVVkit handles this functionality by analyzing several sets
of data for specific model setups. The results of this analysis are
broken down into several categories:

-  Strong and weak scaling plots
-  Variances of runtimes with highlighted deviations from benchmarks
-  Breakdown of runtime of key components of model run

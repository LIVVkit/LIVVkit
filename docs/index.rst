Introduction
============
LIVVkit, the land ice verification & validation toolkit, is a python based V&V toolkit for
computational ice sheet models, in both a stand-alone or coupled (to an Earth system model)
configuration. It is intended to be a comprehensive testing suite that covers:

**Model V&V**

* Numerical verification -- "Are we solving the equations correctly?"
* Physical validation -- "Are we using the right physics?"

**Software V&V**

* Code verification  -- "did we build what *we* wanted?"
* Performance validation -- "did we build what the *users* wanted?"

By integrating LIVVkit into a model's development workflow, LIVVkit will help users and developers
build confidence in their model results, and easily transmit testing data to the wider scientific
community, reviews, and decision/policy makers. 

Currently, LIVVkit is being used and developed in conjunction with E3SM
(`Energy Exascale Earth System Model <https://e3sm.org>`_) and CISM
(`Community Ice Sheet Model <https://cism.github.io/>`_), but is designed to be extensible to
other models.

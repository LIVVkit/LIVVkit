Introduction
-----
LIVVkit (the land ice verification & validation toolkit) is a python based
V&V toolkit for computational ice sheet models. It aims to
provide the following capabilities:

**Model V&V**

* Numerical verification -- "Are we solving the equations correctly?"
* Physical validation -- "Are we using the right physics?"

**Software V&V**

* Code verification  -- "did we build what *we* wanted?"
* Performance validation -- "did we build what the *users* wanted?"

Currently, LIVVkit is being developed and used in conjunction with the
Community Ice Sheet Model
(`CISM <http://oceans11.lanl.gov/cism/documentation.html>`__), but is
designed to be extensible to other models.

Introduction
-----
LIVVkit (the land ice verification & validation toolkit) is a python based
:doc:`V&V <VV>` toolkit for computational ice sheet models. It aims to
provide the following capabilities:

**Model V&V**

* Numerical verification 
* Physical validation

**Software V&V**

* Code verification
* Performance validation

Currently, LIVVkit is being developed and used in conjunction with the
Community Ice Sheet Model
(`CISM <http://oceans11.lanl.gov/cism/documentation.html>`__), but is
designed to be extensible to other models.

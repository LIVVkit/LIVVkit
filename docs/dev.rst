Development
###########

LIVVkit is publicly developed within the `LIVVkit <https://github.com/LIVVkit>`_ project on GitHub
and releases are packaged and distributed on `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/livvkit>`_ and
`Anaconda Cloud <https://anaconda.org/jhkennedy/livvkit>`_.


Workflow
--------

There are two encouraged ways to contribute to the development of LIVVkit:

1. Become a core developer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you have many contributions and are planning on being an active developer, you may request to
become a core developer by contacting `Joseph H. Kennedy <kennedyjh@ornl.gov>`_ and briefely
describing your intended contribution goals. Once approved, you will be given push access to the
``LIVVkit/LIVVkit`` repository (and any other needed repositories). 

When developing the code, please follow the `GitFlow workflow
<https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#gitflow-workflow>`_ and make all your
changes in a feature branch. Feature branches should follow the ``#-username-feature`` naming
convention, where ``#`` indicates the issue  being addressed (optional). 

If you have any questions, concerns, requests, etc., open an issue in our `issues queue
<https://github.com/LIVVkit/LIVVkit/issues>`_, and we will help you out. 

2. For outside contributions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For one-off or infrequent contributions, please use the `Forking Workflow
<https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#forking-workflow>`_ to add
contributions to LIVVkit. 

First, go to the `LIVVkit github page <https://github.com/LIVVkit/LIVVkit>`_ and push the ``Fork``
button on the top right of the page. This will create a fork of LIVVkit in your profile page. Clone
the fork, make your changes, merge them to development branch, and then submit a pull request to our
public repository. 
   

If you have any questions, concerns, requests, etc., open an issue in our `public issues queue
<https://github.com/LIVVkit/LIVVkit/issues>`_, and we will help you out.

This is a README file for creating benchmark files on machines other than Titan (OLCF), Hopper (NERSC), or Mac OSX (local),
so one can properly run the Land Ice V&V (livv) Post-Processing Software on a different machine.

It is recommended that you first successfully run livv on Titan/Rhea so you can get used to the way livv works.
See README_rhea for further instructions.

After a successful run on Titan/Rhea:

  1. Copy reg_test directory from /ccs/proj/cli062/ on rhea or titan (choose the tar file with the most recent date stamp)
     and place on your local system. Create a local higher-order directory on your system where this reg_test will sit. Go ahead
     and check out the code from the repo and copy /PISCEES/trunk/tests/higher-order/livv into this directory as well.

  2.
